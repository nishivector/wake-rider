ONE VERB: DRAFT
GAME IN 10 WORDS: Lone wedge surfs enemy wakes to survive the circuit
WHAT THE PLAYER MASTERS: Reading two objects ahead — your current draft host may lead you into a wall; your real path is the one after next
THE WOW MOMENT: On lap 3, the lead pacer you've been locked behind splits into 5 diverging copies; your entire mental map erases in one second and you have to pick a new slipstream before you bleed to zero speed
WHY RICARDO: Gran Turismo — slipstream is a real physical commitment, not a power-up; weight bleeds out when you break draft and you feel every gram of it. Wipeout — speed is something you earn and lose, recovering from a shattered draft line is pure desperate chaos
EMOTIONAL ARC:
  start: You're embarrassingly slow. You tuck behind the first patrol ship and feel the pull — oh. There it is.
  groove: The convoy becomes a racetrack you read like a circuit; you hop slipstreams like lanes and start building a lap in your head
  climax: The final formation is a tightening spiral; you're threading needle-gaps at top speed, every break-away timed to the frame
WHAT MAKES IT HARD: You must anticipate trajectory two hosts ahead while your current host is actively moving — speed punishes tunnel vision
SKILL CEILING: A 1x player drafts whatever's nearest. A 10x player pre-plans a 4-host chain before the lap begins, never decelerates once, and uses enemy positions as a pre-committed route
VISUAL: #2E5FA3 (mid ocean blue background), #E8C84A (gold wedge + slipstream corona), #FF4D1C (obstacle/danger red) — low rear-chase angle, 10° above horizon; Wipeout vector-neon aesthetic with motion-blur trails
AUDIO: 138 BPM, pulsing synth bass that swells and brightens while drafting, a sharp crack-snap the instant you break away
NOT: no boost-pad pickups scattered on track, no weapons or projectiles
GAME NAME HINT: wake-rider
